(I used with Windows 10)
I included "wxinst21102-beta.exe", simply run through the installation steps this 
file will launch to install WXtoImg. Once installed, launch "xwxtoimg.exe". I followed
the instructions at https://noaa-apt.mbernardi.com.ar/guide.html to get the program
to show maps from wav files. I will copy and paste the instructions I followed below: 

Decoding WAV on WXtoImg
If you want to decode your WAV file on WXtoIMG:

Resample the recording to 11025Hz, you can use noaa-apt for that.

Enable Expert mode, on Options > GUI Options.

Restart WXtoIMG.

File > Load audio file.

Select Satellite > NOAA.

Select Options > Disable map overlay because it could be wrong if you have a wrong timestamp on your file.

File > Decode.

If you want map overlay:

The modification timestamp of the new file should be the moment of the end of the pass. If you resampled the file using noaa-apt it should be OK, otherwise change it if necessary using the noaa-apt GUI or using your terminal.

Uncheck Options > Disable map overlay.

Set Options > Ground Station Location.

Use Enhacements > Normal or any enhacement different than Pristine (because it means no enhacements).

Optional:

Options > Resync.

Options > Disable PLL.

Options > Illumination Compensation.
