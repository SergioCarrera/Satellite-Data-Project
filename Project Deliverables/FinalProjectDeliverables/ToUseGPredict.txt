(I used with Windows 10)
Run "gpredict.exe" in "gpredict-win32-2.3.37" folder, this should should get it to
launch. Upon launching, make sure to go to Edit -> Preferences and change the location 
to desired location, mine was Lincoln, Ne. I'm not sure if it does anything but I 
make sure to do Edit -> Update TLE Data From Network. In the dropdown menu in the 
upper right side of the program, click on Configure and make sure satellites NOAA 15, 
NOAA 18, and NOAA 19 are the selected satellites. Also in the drop down menu, make 
sure Time Controller settings are set to real time. When a satellite range reaches
your location, it's a good time to record using the flow graph. I believe these are
all the changes I had to make upon downloading and first using the program.
